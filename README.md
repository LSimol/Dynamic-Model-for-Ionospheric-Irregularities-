# Dynamic-Model-for-Ionospheric-Irregularities

### Description
The Dynamic Model for Ionospheric Irregularities is a python tool that characterizes the ionospheric irregularity and turbulence indices for different magnetic latitudes, magnetic local times, seasons, solar activity and interplanetary magnetic field orientations at high latitudes of both hemispheres.

The model is based on spherical harmonic decomposition and provides statistical maps of 1) electron density, 2) its rate of change as expressed by the RODI index, and 3) a proxy for ionosphere turbulent processes, for fixed solar activity level, local season and IMF orientation as specified by the user.

Further details regarding the model and its perfomance can be found in Mestici et al. 2024 (submitted)

### Usage

If you plan to use the Model in your research or publications, please make sure to cite the corresponding paper. 

An example on how plot the output of the model is provided in the example.py file.
